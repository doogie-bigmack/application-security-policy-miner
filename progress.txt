## 2026-01-08 - Risk Scoring Multi-Dimensional Analysis Complete

### Completed
- Backend risk scoring implementation:
  - Added historical_score field to Policy model
  - Created RiskScoringService with multi-dimensional calculation:
    - Complexity Score (0-100): Measures policy and code complexity
      - Factors: conditions length, logical operators, nesting depth, code lines
    - Impact Score (0-100): Measures potential damage if policy is wrong
      - Factors: resource sensitivity (PII, financial), action destructiveness (delete, modify), subject privilege
    - Confidence Score (0-100): Measures extraction confidence
      - Factors: evidence count, authorization keywords, field specificity
    - Historical Score (0-100): Placeholder for future change tracking (returns 0 for now)
  - Overall Risk Score calculation with weighted formula:
    - Impact (40%) + Complexity (30%) + Inverted Confidence (20%) + Historical (10%)
  - Updated scanner to use RiskScoringService for all extracted policies
  - Removed fake AI-generated risk scores from prompts

- Backend API updates:

    - Formula explanation shown at bottom
  - Clean, professional card design matching design system

- Database migration:
  - Added historical_score column to policies table
  - Dropped and recreated tables with new schema
  - All containers restarted with updated schema

- Testing:
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for RiskScoringService
  - 9 test cases covering all scoring dimensions:
    - Simple and complex complexity scoring
    - Low and high impact scoring
    - Strong and weak confidence scoring

## 2026-01-08 - Multi-Tenancy Complete

### Completed
- Backend authentication and authorization:
  - Created Tenant and User models with tenant_id foreign key
  - Implemented JWT authentication with email/password
  - Created HTTPBearer security dependency
  - Added get_current_user and get_tenant_id dependencies
  - Used bcrypt directly for password hashing (avoiding passlib bug)

- Backend API endpoints:
  - POST /api/v1/auth/login - User login returning JWT
  - POST /api/v1/auth/tenants/ - Create tenant
  - POST /api/v1/auth/users/ - Create user
  - GET /api/v1/auth/tenants/ - List all tenants
  - Added tenant_id filtering to all repository endpoints
  - All repository CRUD operations are now tenant-aware

- Tenant isolation implementation:
  - All models have tenant_id field with index
  - Repository queries filter by tenant_id when authenticated
  - Unauthenticated requests see all data (for backwards compatibility)
  - Users can only access their own tenant's data
  - Foreign key constraint ensures users belong to valid tenants

- Testing:
  - Created two tenants (tenant_a, tenant_b)
  - Created users for each tenant
  - Created repositories for each tenant
  - Verified User A only sees their repositories
  - Verified User B only sees their repositories
  - Verified User B cannot access User A's repository by ID (404 error)
  - ✅ Tenant isolation working correctly!

### Implementation Details
- JWT tokens contain user email and tenant_id
- Dependencies extract tenant_id from JWT and pass to service layer
- Service layer filters all queries by tenant_id
- BCrypt used directly (avoiding passlib wrapper due to known bug)
- Email validation added via pydantic[email]
- All endpoints maintain backward compatibility (work without auth)

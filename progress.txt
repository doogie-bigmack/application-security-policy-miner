# Progress Log

## 2026-01-08 - Git Repository Integration Complete

### Completed
- Fixed database table initialization in backend/app/main.py
  - Added Base.metadata.create_all() to startup event
  - Tables are now created automatically on application start

- Verified Git repository integration works end-to-end:
  - Backend API endpoints functional (/api/v1/repositories)
  - Repository model and schemas implemented
  - Git connection verification working (uses GitPython)
  - Support for public repos and private repos with token/username+password auth
  - Status tracking (pending -> connected/failed)

- Frontend fully functional:
  - RepositoriesPage displays repository list
  - AddRepositoryModal allows adding Git repositories
  - Form supports all auth types (none, token, username+password)
  - Error handling and validation working

- Tested:
  - Created public repository (https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git) - status: connected
  - Created private repository with fake token - status: failed (expected)
  - List repositories API returns all repos correctly

### User Story Status
✅ Story 1: "Discovery Initiation - Integrate with asset management and accept Git repositories" - PASSES

### Next Steps
- Story 2: Database connections
- Story 3: AI Rule Mining - code scanning

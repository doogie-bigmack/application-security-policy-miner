## 2026-01-08 - Risk Scoring Multi-Dimensional Analysis Complete

### Completed
- Backend risk scoring implementation:
  - Added historical_score field to Policy model
  - Created RiskScoringService with multi-dimensional calculation:
    - Complexity Score (0-100): Measures policy and code complexity
      - Factors: conditions length, logical operators, nesting depth, code lines
    - Impact Score (0-100): Measures potential damage if policy is wrong
      - Factors: resource sensitivity (PII, financial), action destructiveness (delete, modify), subject privilege
    - Confidence Score (0-100): Measures extraction confidence
      - Factors: evidence count, authorization keywords, field specificity
    - Historical Score (0-100): Placeholder for future change tracking (returns 0 for now)
  - Overall Risk Score calculation with weighted formula:
    - Impact (40%) + Complexity (30%) + Inverted Confidence (20%) + Historical (10%)
  - Updated scanner to use RiskScoringService for all extracted policies
  - Removed fake AI-generated risk scores from prompts

- Backend API updates:
  - Added historical_score to PolicyCreate and Policy schemas
  - All risk scores properly returned in API responses
  - OpenAPI schema validated with historical_score field

- Frontend implementation:
  - Added historical_score to Policy interface
  - Created expandable risk breakdown UI on policy cards
  - Click on risk score to see detailed breakdown:
    - Complexity, Impact, Confidence, Historical scores displayed in grid
    - Each score shows description of what it measures
    - Formula explanation shown at bottom
  - Clean, professional card design matching design system

- Database migration:
  - Added historical_score column to policies table
  - Dropped and recreated tables with new schema
  - All containers restarted with updated schema

- Testing:
  - Created comprehensive unit tests for RiskScoringService
  - 9 test cases covering all scoring dimensions:
    - Simple and complex complexity scoring
    - Low and high impact scoring
    - Strong and weak confidence scoring
    - Historical score (placeholder)
    - Overall risk score calculations
  - All tests passing

### Implementation Details

- High confidence reduces risk (inverted in formula)
- Historical score ready for future implementation with change tracking
- Frontend shows scores on demand (click to expand)

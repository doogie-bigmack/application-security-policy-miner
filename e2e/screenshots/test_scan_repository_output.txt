Perfect! I found the bug. On lines 980, 991, 996, 1001, and 1006, the code is calling `.get()` on `match` objects, expecting them to be dictionaries with keys like `"line"`, `"java_detail"`, etc. However, from line 644 in `_stream_authorization_files`, `matches` is just a list of pattern strings: `matches.append(pattern)`.

This is a code bug - the scanner is passing `list[str]` but the extraction function expects `list[dict]`.

## Test Result Summary

### ❌ TEST FAILED: test_scan_repository

**Failure Reason**: Backend code bug preventing policy extraction

**What Happened**:
1. ✅ Successfully navigated to repositories page
2. ✅ Found test-auth-patterns repository  
3. ✅ Successfully clicked "Start Scan" button
4. ✅ Scan initiated and completed in ~5 seconds
5. ❌ **0 policies extracted** (expected >= 5)
6. ❌ **2 errors occurred** during scan

**Root Cause**:
Bug in `backend/app/services/scanner_service.py`:
- Line 644: `_stream_authorization_files` yields `matches` as `list[str]` (pattern strings)
- Line 842: `_extract_policies_from_file` expects `matches: list[dict]`  
- Line 980: Code calls `match["line"]` on a string, causing `'str' object has no attribute 'get'` error

**Error Messages**:
```
Error processing file java/RestController.java: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
Error processing file python/flask_decorators.py: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Evidence**:
- Screenshot: `/tmp/playwright-output/test_scan_repository_failure_details.png`
- Screenshot: `/tmp/playwright-output/test_scan_repository_policies_page.png`
- Backend logs show the errors for 2 files
- Scan #8 completed with: Files: 4, Policies: 0, Errors: 2

**Expected vs Actual**:
- Expected: >= 5 policies extracted
- Actual: 0 policies extracted
- Expected: 0 errors  
- Actual: 2 errors

**Impact**: This is a critical bug that breaks the core functionality of the Policy Miner. No policies can be extracted until this data structure mismatch is fixed.
